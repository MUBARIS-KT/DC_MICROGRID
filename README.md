# DC_MICROGRID

This repository contains MATLAB and Arduino code developed for a DC microgrid project, focusing on bidirectional converters and digital multimeter functionality. The codes provided aim to facilitate efficient power management, monitoring, and control within a DC microgrid setup.

## Repository Structure

- **MATLAB Code for Bidirectional Converters:** Scripts and functions for simulating and controlling bidirectional converters within a DC microgrid environment, supporting energy flow management and stability.
- **Arduino Code for Digital Multimeter:** A set of Arduino sketches that implement digital multimeter functionalities, enabling accurate measurement of voltage, current, and other parameters.

## Getting Started

Each project component is organized in its own directory:

- **Bidirectional Converters (MATLAB):** Contains MATLAB files for modeling, simulation, and control logic for bidirectional power flow.
- **Digital Multimeter (Arduino):** Includes Arduino sketches for creating a digital multimeter with real-time measurements.

## Requirements

To work with the code in this repository, you will need:

- **MATLAB** for running and modifying the bidirectional converter models.
- **Arduino IDE** for uploading and running the digital multimeter code on an Arduino-compatible microcontroller.

## Usage

1. **MATLAB Files:** Open MATLAB and navigate to the relevant folder. Run the simulation files to explore bidirectional converter performance under different conditions.
2. **Arduino Files:** Use the Arduino IDE to open and upload the digital multimeter code to your microcontroller. Connect the required sensors for voltage and current measurements.
